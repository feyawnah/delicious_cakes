  <p>INGREDIENTS</p>
  <p>Unsalted butter, softened, for pans</p>
  <p>3/4 cup unsweetened Dutch cocoa powder, plus more for pans</p>
  <p>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</p>
  <p>1 1/2 cups sugar</p>
  <p>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</p>
  <p>3/4 teaspoon baking powder</p>
  <p>3/4 teaspoon salt</p>
  <p>2 large eggs</p>
  <p>3/4 cup low-fat buttermilk</p>
  <p>3/4 cup warm water</p>
  <p>3 tablespoons safflower oil</p>
  <p>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</p>
  <p> 1 - Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter two 8-inch round cake pans (2 inches deep); dust with cocoa. Sift cocoa, flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into the bowl of a mixer. Beat on low speed until just combined. Raise speed to medium, and add eggs, buttermilk, water, oil, and vanilla. Beat until smooth, about 3 minutes.</p>
  <p> 2 - Divide batter between pans. Bake until set and a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes. Turn out from pans. Transfer, faceup, to wire racks. Let cool completely.</p>
  <p> 3 - Spread 2 cups chocolate frosting onto top of 1 cooled layer. Top with remaining layer; frost top and sides with remaining 2 cups frosting.</p>
