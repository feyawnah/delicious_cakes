  <p>INGREDIENTS</p><!--we should check this list-->
  <p>Unsalted butter, for cake pans</p>
  <p>2 1/2 cups cake flour, not self-rising</p>
  <p>1 teaspoon salt</p>
  <p>1/4 cup cocoa powder</p>
  <p>1 1/2 cups sugar</p>
  <p>1 1/2 cups canola oil</p>
  <p>2 large eggs</p>
  <p>1/4 cup red food coloring</p>
  <p>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</p>
  <p>1 cup buttermilk</p>
  <p>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</p>
  <p>2 teaspoons white vinegar</p>
  <p> 1 - Heat oven to 350 degrees. Generously butter two 9-by-2-inch round cake pans. Sprinkle with flour, and tap out the excess; set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk cake flour, salt, and cocoa; set aside.</p>
  <p> 2 - In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the sugar and oil, and beat on medium speed until well combined. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add food coloring and vanilla, and beat until well combined. Add flour mixture, alternating with buttermilk, scraping the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed.</p>
  <p> 3 - In a small bowl, mix baking soda and vinegar until combined. Add to batter, and beat for 10 seconds. Evenly divide batter between the prepared pans. Bake until a cake tester inserted in the center of each cake comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool in the pans for 5 minutes. Remove from the pans, and return to the rack to cool completely.</p>
  <p> 4 - Spread 1 1/2 cups of the frosting on one of the layers. Place the second layer on top; spread and swirl the remaining frosting around the sides and top of the cake.The cake can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 6 hours. Bring to room temperature before serving.</p>
